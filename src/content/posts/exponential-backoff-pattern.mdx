Exponential Backoff pattern is a strategy where a system retries an operation (like polling data or handling failed requests) with increasing delays between each attempt.
The delay typically grows exponentially, often doubling after each retry, to reduce load and give the system time to recover.

## How It Works
- **Initial Attempt**: When a request fails due to transient issues (e.g., network failure, rate limiting), the system waits for a short delay before retrying.
- **Exponential Increase**: If the request keeps failing, the delay between retries increases exponentially, usually doubling each time.
- **Max Attempts/Backoff Cap**: To prevent infinite retries, there is often a maximum retry limit or a maximum wait time.

## Formula
The delay between retries is often calculated as:

T = B Ã— 2<sup>n</sup>

Where:

T = Wait time before the next attempt

B = Base delay (e.g., 100ms)

n = Retry attempt number

To introduce randomness and avoid collisions in concurrent systems, jitter (randomized delay) is often added.

## Implementation in Typescript
```ts
function waitFor(milliseconds: number) {
  return new Promise((resolve) =>
    setTimeout(resolve, milliseconds));
}

function retry<T>(
  promise: () => Promise<T>,
  onRetry: () => void,
  {
    maxRetries,
    withJitter = true
  }: {
    maxRetries: number
    withJitter?: boolean
  }) {
  async function retryWithBackoff(retries: number) {
    try {
      if (retries > 0) {
        // Exponential backoff
        const baseDelay = 2 ** retries * 100;
        // Jitter factor (random between 0.5x and 1.5x)
        const jitter = withJitter ?
          Math.random() + 0.5 :
          1;
        const timeToWait = baseDelay * jitter;

        console.log(`waiting for ${timeToWait}ms...`);
        await waitFor(timeToWait);
      }
      return await promise();
    } catch (e) {
      if (retries < maxRetries) {
        onRetry();
        return retryWithBackoff(retries + 1);
      } else {
        console.warn("Max retries reached.");
        throw e;
      }
    }
  }

  return retryWithBackoff(0);
}

function generateFailableAPICall(retries: number) {
  let counter = 0;
  return function () {
    if (counter < retries) {
      counter++;
      return Promise.reject(new Error("Simulated error"));
    } else {
      return Promise.resolve({ status: "ok" });
    }
  };
}

/*** Testing our Retry with Exponential Backoff */
async function test() {
  const apiCall = generateFailableAPICall(3);
  const result = await retry(
    apiCall,
    () => {
      console.log("onRetry called...");
    },
    {
      maxRetries: 4,
      withJitter: false
    }
  );

  console.log(result.status === "ok");
}

test();
```
